# EV3Python
Detailing my journey into the wonderful world of EV3 Lego Robotics, combined with a very easy language: Python!

# Getting Started
To get started, go to (Python for EV3)[https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3]

# Note: 
Each program has comments, so if you're new, don't worry!

# Also:
I had to use separate functions because apparently, when you set up a Python with EV3 Project, only main.py will be run when you download the code to your EV3 Brick. So, if you would like to run a program from a function here, enter the function name at the bottom under the designated comment. Thanks!
